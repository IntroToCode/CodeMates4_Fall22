## Servings: 
Serves 10

## Time to prepare: 
Prep: 15 minutes Cook: 10 minutes Total: 25 minutes

## Ingredients:
1. 1 tablespoon Olive Oil
2. 1 pound shredded chicken (rotisserie chicken preferred)
3. 1/2 cup diced onions
4. 1 can diced tomato (fully drained)
5. 1 can chopped green chilly (fully drained)
6. At least 10 Stand and Stuff Taco Shells (El Paso)
7. 1/2 can of refried beans 
8. 2 cups of cheese
9. Toppings of your choice (jalapeno, sour cream, avocado, shredded lettuce, chopped cilantro)

## Equipment needed:
1. Oven
2. Medium skillet
3. Spoons for mixing and stirring
4. Knife for cutting
5. Baking dish
6. Baking sheets

## Steps for preparation:

1. Preheat oven to 400°F. Spray a 9×13 baking dish with nonstick spray.
2. Heat olive oil over medium heat in a medium skillet.
3. Add onion to skillet and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until the onion is translucent and fragrant.
4. Stir in the chicken, taco seasoning, tomatoes (FULLY DRAINED), and green chiles (FULLY DRAINED) *see note. Stir to combine fully. Reduce to simmer and allow to cook for 5-8 minutes.
5. Place the taco shells in the baking dish, standing up. I was able to fit 10 taco shells in the dish by adding 2 on each side.
6. Bake the taco shells for 5 minutes by themselves to allow them to crisp up. Remove from the oven.
7. Spoon 1 tablespoon of beans into the bottom of each taco shell. Top with the chicken mixture, almost to the top of each shell.
8. Sprinkle each shell generously with shredded cheese, the more the better!
9. Bake for 7-10 minutes or until cheese is fully melted and the edges of the shells are browned.
10. Remove from the oven and top with your favorite items such as jalapenos, sour cream, cilantro, and salsa.


### Notes:

#### Don’t forget to top these with a LOT of cheese! That’s the only way to make them. We aren’t playing around when it comes to melted cheese!

3. Salsa (pico de gallo, salsa verde, blender salsa)
